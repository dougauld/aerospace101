<H3>Wave Propagation</H3>
<P>
Information regarding flow properties propogates via waves. These waves travel at the local
speed of sound. There is a noticable contrast between
incompressible and compressible flows. For an incompressible fluid
the speed of sound is infinite (Mach number is zero).
Consequently, information in the form of pressure, density and
velocity changes is conveyed to all parts of the flow
instantaneously. The flow therefore changes instantaneously due to an intrduced disturbance.
The stream lines of an incompressible flow are continuous and the flow changes
smoothly to accommodate the presence of a body placed in the flow. Changes occur 
far upstream of the body.This may not happen
in compressible flows. In a compressible medium
any disturbance travels only at finite speeds. Signals generated at
a point in the flow take a finite time to reach other parts of the
flow. The smooth streamline pattern noticed for incompressible
flow may now be absent. </p><p>
In this section an expression for the speed of sound is derived. 
The difference between supersonic flow and subsonic flow responses to a disturbance 
due to the presence of anobstacle in the flow will be investigated. Shock waves may be 
formed in compressible flows.
</p>
<H2>Speed of Sound</H2>
<p>
Consider a sound wave propagating to the right as shown (<i>Fig. 11</i>)
with a speed $a$. The medium to the right is at rest and
has pressure, density and temperature $P, &rho;, T$ respectively.
As a consequence of wave motion the medium gets compressed and the
gas is set to motion. Let the speed of gas behind the wave be
$du$. Pressure, Density and temperature will now be $P+dP, &rho;+d&rho;, T+dT$
respectively.</p>
<center>
<img src="sndspeed.gif" width="614" height="367"><br />
<u>Figure 11 :  Speed of Sound </u>
</center>
<p>
For analysis it is easier to make the wave stationary, ie. choose a frame of reference that is moving with the wave.
Accordingly,
 an equal and opposite  speed $a$
 (equal to the wave speed) is superimposed. This is shown in part (b)
of <i>Fig. 11</i>.
</p>
<P>
Applying the equations of mass and momentum to the control volume
shown gives,
</P><p>
$$&rho;a=(&rho;+d&rho;)(a-du)$$<br />
$$P+&rho;a^2=(P+dP)+(&rho;+d&rho;)(a-du)^2$$
</p>
<P>
Simplifying the continuity equation and ignoring the small products
such as $du.d&rho;$ gives,
</P>
<p>
$$ad&rho;=&rho;du$$
</p>
<p>
Replacing the term $(&rho;+d&rho;)(a-du)$
 in the momentum equation, leads to </p><p>
$$P+&rho;a^2=(P+dP)+(&rho;a)(a-du)$$</p><p>
which simplifies to </p><p>$$dP=&rho;adu$$
</p>
<P>
Combining Eqns.,
</P><p>
$$dp=a^2d&rho;$$<br />
$$a^2={dP}/{d&rho;}$$
</p>
<P>
If the propagation of a sound wave is considered to be an isentropic
process, the above equation becomes,
</P><p>
$$a^2=({dP}/{d&rho;})_s$$
</p>
<P>
For a perfect gas the above expression reduces to,
</P><p>
$$a^2=&gamma;RT\text"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"a=&radic;{&gamma;RT}$$
</p>
<P>
Any change in flow conditions is transmitted to
other parts of the flow by means of waves travelling at the local
speed of sound. The ratio of flow speed to the speed of sound ,
called <i>Mach Number</i>, is an important parameter for a
given flow. As an equation,
</P><p>
$$M=u/a$$
</p>
<P>
Mach Number is a measure of the relative importance of
compressibility effects for a given flow.
</P>
<H2>Propagation of a Source of Sound</H2>
<P>
A point source of sound will produce different disturbances in the flow if it moves at different speeds.
</P><p>
<B>Stationary Source
</B>
</p>
<P>
A stationary source emits a sound waves at regular intervals
eg. every second. The waves travel in the form of a circle
with the centre at the location of the source as shown in <i>Fig.
 12 (a)</i>. After 3 seconds there will be three concentric
circles as shown. The effect of the sound source is felt at a point as the edge of a circle reaches that point.
</p>
<p><b>Source moving at Subsonic Speeds
</b></P>
<P>
If the source moves to the left at half the speed of sound, i.e., $M = 0.5$ then the source will be at different positions as the waves are released as shown. 
In this case the sound travels faster than the particle, but the particle moves
 so that the origin of each circel is different and the waves produced are 
 closer together on the side toward which the particle is moving. This gives 
 rise to the <i>Doppler</i> effect where frequency of the waves to a stationary observer appears different if they are infront of the moving object or behind.
</p>

<u>Figure 12: Propagation of a Source of Sound at different speeds</u>
</center>
<p>
<b>Source moving at the Speed of Sound</b>
<P>
In the situation where the source moves at the speed of
sound, i.e., <i>Fig 12(c)</i> then sound waves 
travel with the particle speed and do not "<i>outrun</i>" it.
Consequently, the circles representing wave motion touch each
other as shown. A line which is tangential to each of
these circles can be drawn such that any effect of the sound wave is felt only to the
right of this line. In the region to the left of the line no
effect of the source of the sources is detected until the particle reaches that point.
These regions are designated "<i>Zone of Action</i>" and "<i>Zone of Silence</i>" respectively.
</p>
<p><b>Source moving at Supersonic Speeds</b>
</p>
<P>
The situation becomes dramatic when the source moves at speeds
greater than the speed of sound. The boundary between the Zone of
Silence and the Zone of Action is not a single straight line, but
two lines meeting at the current position of the source. In
addition, the Zone of Action is now a more restricted region. A stationary
observer does not hear any sound till they are within the Zone of Action. 
This is a common experience when a supersonic aircraft flies past.  An observer on
the ground first sees the aircraft but hears nothing. They have to wait
till the aircraft flies past and "immerses" them in the Zone
of Action. In case of a subsonic aircraft, the observer
hears the sound as the aircraft approaches.</p>
<P>
The boundary between the two zones is called a <i>Shock Wave</i>
It is a straight line where the sound disturbances have coalesed and where there will then be a 
step change in gas properties. If the shock wave is relatively weak producing 
only minimal changes in properties, then it is called a <i>Mach Wave</i>
The half angle of the wedge produced at supersonic speeds by a weak wave is 
called the <i>Mach Angle</i>, $&mu;$.
</P><p>
$$&mu;=\sin^{-1}(a/u)=\sin^{-1}(1/M)$$
</p>
<P>
Mach Angle is a function of the Mach Number of the flow and is in
 this sense a property of the flow. Values are listed in Tables at the end of this section.

<H2>Response of Subsonic and Supersonic Flows to an Obstacle</H2>
<P>
If an obstacle placed in subsonic or supersonic then its presence produces disturbances moving at the speed of sound 
and will have different effects upon the flow depending on Mach Number.
</p>
<CENTER>
<img src="disturbance.gif" width="507" height="570"><br />
<u>Figure 13 : A Body placed in Subsonic and Supersonic Flows </u>
</center>
<H3>Subsonic Flow
</H3>
<p>
If a body is placed in a subsonic stream, any disturbances
 propagate at the speed of sound. 
 Since the incoming flow is slower than sound, these disturbances can
 propagate upstream. As they propagate upstream, they modify the
 incoming flow. Consequently the flow adjusts itself to the
 presence of the body sufficiently upstream and flows past the
 body smoothly. This is also what happens with incompressible
 flows where the speed of sound is effectively infinite.
</P>
<H3>Supersonic Flow</H3>
<P>
With a supersonic flow disturbances are formed as a result of
 flow interacting with the body. But now they cannot propagate
 upstream because the incoming flow is faster. Any signal that
 tries to go upstream is pushed back towards the body. These
 signals, unable to go upstream, pile up closed to the body (<i>Fig. 13</i>).
 The incoming flow is therefore not "warned" of the presence of
 the body. It flows as if the body is absent until it encounters the
 region where the disturbances have builtup up. Then the flow suddenly
 modifies itself to accommodate the presence of the body. This
 marks a sharp difference between subsonic and supersonic flows.
</p>
<P>
The example indicates that in a supersonic flow disturbances
 cannot propagate upstream. This technically stated as "<i>In a Supersonic
 flow there is no upstream influence</i>". Further the region where
 the disturbances have "piled up" is a <i>Shock Wave</i>. These are
 regions of infinitesimally small thickness across
 which flow properties such as pressure,
 density and temperature can sometimes jump, orders of magnitude, depending upon the Mach Number of the flow.
</p>
<H3>Shock Waves
</H3>
<P>
The analysis of shock waves for 1-D flow are considered in this section, 
In a later section this will be expanded to cover two-dimensional flows.
</P>
<H2>Formation of a Shock Wave</H2>
<P>
A piston-cylinder arrangement is shown in <i>Fig. 14</i>. A gas is at
 rest in front of the piston with pressure, density and
 temperature given by $P, &rho;$ and $T$. The piston will start moving at 
time, $t=0$. This start-up produces disturbances, compression waves in the flow. A weak wave is
 emitted (<i>a</i> in the figure). The wave moves to  right at a speed $a$ , i.e., the speed
 of sound. The wave as it propagates sets the gas into motion.
 Accordingly behind the wave is a medium which is slightly
 compressed. Its properties are given by $P+dP_1, &rho;+d&rho;_1$
 and $T+dT_1$.</p>
 <p>If the piston is given an increase in speed (<i>b</i> in the figure), 
 then another disturbance wave is generated.
 Its speed, however is not $a$ , but is $a + da_1$.
 This wave has a higher speed because it is generated in a medium
 of higher temperature. The second wave chasing the
first will eventually catchup and merge with the
 first one to produce a stronger wave. The pressure jump across
 the stronger wave is not $dP_1$  but is $dP_1+dP_2$. This phenomenon where
 the waves merge is called <i>Coalescence</i>.
</p>
<CENTER>
<img src="shform.gif" width="602" height="419"><br />
<u>Figure 14 : Formation of a Shock Wave </u>
</center>
<p>
If the situation is one where the piston is accelerated over a period of time
 (<i>a,b,c</i> and <i>d</i> in <i>Fig. 14</i>) or the piston is pushed continuously, then
 there will be a train of
 waves where each wave is stronger and faster than the one before.
 Very soon these waves coalesce into a strong wave with a measurable pressure and temperature
 jump across it. This is a <i>Shock
 Wave</i>.</P>
<H2>Normal Shock Waves</H2>
<p>The formation of shock waves can occur in two different situations.</p>
<OL>
<LI>when a supersonic flow negotiates an obstacle and</li>
<li>when a piston is pushed inside a cylinder.</li>
</ol>
<p> In order to analyse a shock and see how flow properties change, it is 
easiest to choose a stationary frame of reference which moves with the wave. 
This is applicable to both situations in 1-D flow. 
The shock wave is assumed to be <i>normal</i> to the flow and across it 
properties can jump by big magnitudes. 
A <i>normal shock</i> in a flow with a Mach number of $3$ will have a pressure 
which jumps $10.333$ times across it. This jump occurs in a distance of about 
$10^{-6}$ cm. The shock thickness is so small that for all practical purposes it is a discontinuity. 
</p>
<center><img src="shockwave.gif" width="215" height="320"><br />
<u>Figure 15 : Shock Wave</u>
</center>
<p>
Consider a shock wave as shown, across which pressure, density,
 temperature, velocity,etc, jump from $P_1, &rho;_1, T_1, u_$ ...
 to $P_2, &rho;_2, T_2, u_2$ .
 If a control volume is put around it, assuming no change in area between <i>1</i> and <i>2</i>
then the governing equations are
</p>
<p>
$$&rho;_1u_1=&rho;_2u_2$$<br />
$$P_1+&rho;_1u_1^2=P_2+&rho;_2u_2^2$$<br />
$$h_1+u_1^2/2=h_2+u_2^2/2$$
</p><p>
Noting that the term $&rho;u^2$ in the momentum equation is
</P>
<p>
$$&rho;u^2=P/{RT}M^2a^2=P/{RT}M^2&gamma;RT=&gamma;PM^2$$
</p>
<P>
The momentum equation now becomes,</P><p>
$$P_1(1+&gamma;M_1^2)=P_2(1+&gamma;M_2^2)$$
</p>
<P>
The energy equation requires that
 total enthalpy, $h_0=h+u^2\/2$ is constant across the
 shock. Accordingly, 
</P><p>
$$h_{01} = h_{02}$$</p> 
<p>which for a perfect gas becomes, $T_{01}=T_{02}$, substituting gives,
</P><p>
$$T_1(1+{&gamma;-1}/2M_1^2)=T_2(1+{&gamma;-1}/2M_2^2)$$
</p>
<P>
The expressions derived are for temperature and
 pressure ratio across a shock wave. Density ratio follows from
 the perfect gas equation,
</P><p>
$$&rho;_2/&rho;_1=P_2/{RT_2}{RT_1}/P_1=P_2/P_1 T_1/T_2$$
</p>
<P>
Substituting for $&rho;u$ as $P/{RT}M&radic;{&gamma;RT}$
 the continuity equation becomes,
</P>
<p>
$$P_1/&radic;{T_1} M_1= P_2/&radic;{T_2} M_2$$
</p>
<P>
Substituting for pressure ratio,
</P><p>
$$M_1/{&radic;{T_1}(1+&gamma;M_1^2)}=M_2/{&radic;{T_2}(1+&gamma;M_2^2)}$$
</p>

<P>
Substituting for temperature ratio, 
</P><p>
$$M_1^2/{(1+&gamma;M_1^2)^2}(1+{&gamma;-1}/2M_1^2)=M_2^2/{(1+&gamma;M_2^2)^2}(1+{&gamma;-1}/2M_2^2)$$
</p>
<P>
This equation connects Mach Numbers across a normal
 shock. The Mach number downstream of the shock, $M_2$
 is a function of Mach Number upstream of the shock, $M_1$
 and ratio of specific heats, $&gamma;$.</p>
<p> 
The equation has two solutions given by,
</P>
<p>
$$M_2^2=&plusmn;M_1^2$$<br />
$$M_2^2=&plusmn;{1+{&gamma;-1}/2M_1^2}/{&gamma;M_1^2-{&gamma;-1}/2}$$
</p>
<P>
Any imaginary solutions for these Eqns are ruled out. One of the possible 
solutions, $M_1 = M_2$  is   trivial
 telling that there is only an extremely weak shock.
</P>
<P>
Once the relationship between $M_2$ and 
 $M_1$ has been found, the relationships that
 connect pressure, density, and other variables across the shock can be derived.
 This is done by substituting for $M_2$ in the equations derived
 above.</p><p>
 The final form of the equations are,
</P>
<p>
$$M_2^2={1+{&gamma;-1}/2M_1^2}/{&gamma;M_1^2-{&gamma;-1}/2}$$<br />
$$P_2/P_1=1 + 2/{&gamma;+1}(M_1^2-1)$$<br />
$$&rho;_2/&rho;_1=u_1/u_2={(&gamma;+1)M_1^2}/{(&gamma;-1)M_1^2+2}$$<br />
$$T_2/T_1={(1+{&gamma;-1}/2M_1^2)({2&gamma;}/{&gamma;-1}M_1^2 -1)}/{M_1^2({2&gamma;}/{&gamma;-1}+{&gamma;-1}/2)}$$
</p>
<P>
Considering now the "<i>Total</i>" properties,
</P><p>
$$T_{02}/T_{01}=1 $$<br />
$$P_{02}/P_{01}=({1/2(&gamma;+1)M_1^2}/{1+1/2(&gamma;-1)M_1^2})^{&gamma;/{&gamma;-1}}(1/{{2&gamma;}/{&gamma;+1}M_1^2-{&gamma;-1}/{&gamma;+1}})^{1/{&gamma;-1}}$$
</p>

<P>
Change in entropy across the shock is given by
</P><p>
$$s_2-s_1=c_p\ln(T_2/T_1)-R\ln(P_2/P_1)$$
</p><p>
and</p><p>
$${s_2-s_1}/R= -ln(P_{02}/P_{01})$$
</p><p>
which in terms of $M_1$  alone becomes,
</P><p>
$${s_2-s_1}/R=1/{&gamma;-1}\ln({2&gamma;M_1^2}/{&gamma;-1}-{&gamma;-1}/{&gamma;+1})+&gamma;/{&gamma;-1}\ln({2+(&gamma;-1)M_1^2}/{(&gamma;+1)M_1^2})$$

Tables and scripts at the end of this section have the values of the ratios of pressure,

<li>If $M_1 > 1$  then $ M_2 &lt; 1$ , i.e, if the incoming flow
is <i>supersonic </i>, the outgoing flow is <i>subsonic</i>. </li>
<li>If $M_1 &lt; 1$ then $M_2 > 1$ , i.e, if the incoming flow is
<i>subsonic</i>, the outgoing flow is <i>supersonic</i>.</li>
</ul>
<P>
It appears that both the solutions are mathematically possible. But if the entropy change of the situation is investigated
(<i>Fig 16(b)</i>) then a fundamental rule of thermodynamics is violated by one of the solutions.

It comes out that if $M_1 &lt; 1$ then we have a decrease in
entropy across the shock, which is a violation of the second law
 and therefore a physical impossibility. This
solution would give a shock  which tries to expand a flow and
decrease pressure. Hence, it is clear that expansion shocks are ruled
out.</p>
<p>If $M_1 &gt; 1$ there is an increase in entropy, which
is physically possible. This is a compressive shock across which
pressure increases.  So the traffic rules for compressible flows
are such that shocks are always compressive, incoming flow is
always supersonic and the outgoing flow is always subsonic.
