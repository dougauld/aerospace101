<h3>Integral Approach<br /><br />Control Volume analysis of Fluid Flow</h3>
<h2>Basic
Concepts </h2>
<h2>Velocity</h2>
<center>
<IMG SRC="velocity_field.png" NAME="Picture 2" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=460 HEIGHT=296 BORDER=0><br><br>
<U>Figure 1 : Velocity Field</U></center>
<p>
The velocity
field defines a distribution of velocity in a given region,  R
(<i>Fig.1</i>). It is denoted in a functional form as <B>$V&nwarr;{&rarr;}(x,y,z,t)$.
</B>Velocity
is a function of spatial and time coordinates. Fluid flow is assumed
to be a continuum which allows velocity to be defined at a point.
Velocity is a vector quantity, it has a direction along with a
magnitude. Velocity field can be written as 
</P>
<p >
$$V&nwarr;{&rarr;} = V&nwarr;{&rarr;}(u,v,w,t) $$
</p>
<P >
Velocity
can have three components, one in each direction,<B>
u,v</B> and <B>w</B>
in <B>x, y </B>and
<B>z</B>
directions respectively and can vary with time <b>t</b>. It is usual to write $V&nwarr;{&rarr;}$ as </P>
<p>
$$ V&nwarr;{&rarr;} = u.i&nwarr;{&rarr;} + v.j&nwarr;{&rarr;} + w.k&nwarr;{&rarr;} $$
</p>
<P >
Each of <B>u,v</B>
and <B>w</B> can be functions of <B>x,y,z</B> and <B>t</B>.
</P>
<p>
$$ V&nwarr;{&rarr;} = u(x,y,z,t).i&nwarr;{&rarr;} + v(x,y,z,t).j&nwarr;{&rarr;} + w(x,y,z,t).k&nwarr;{&rarr;} $$
</p>
<P >
Most
other variables involved in a fluid flow can also be given a field
representation. We have temperature field, <B>T(x,y,z,t)</B>,
pressure field, <B>P(x,y,z,t)</B>, density field, <b>&rho;(x,y,z,t)</b>, etc. 
</P>
<h3>Steady and Unsteady Flows </h3>
<P >
Velocity,
pressure and other properties of fluid flow can be functions of time.
If a flow is such that the properties at every point in the flow do
not depend upon time, it is called a <B>steady </B>flow.
</P>
<P >
For steady flows, 
</P>
<p>
$$ {&part;X}/{&part;t} = 0 $$
</p>
<P >
where
<B>X</B> is
any property such as pressure, velocity or density. Thus <b>X=X(x,y,z)</b>.</P>
<P >
<B>Unsteady</B>
or<B>
non-steady</B> flow is one where the
properties do depend on time. 
</P>
<P >
Any
flow start up process is unsteady. Many examples can be given from
everyday life: eg. water flow out of a tap which has just been opened.
This flow is unsteady to start with, but with time can become steady.
</P>
<P >
Some flows, though unsteady, become steady by choosing a particular frame of
reference. These are called <B>pseudosteady</B>
flows. On the other hand, a flow such as the wake behind a bluff body
is always unsteady. 
</P>
<P >
Unsteady flows are difficult to calculate while steady flows are less
difficult  having one degree less complexity. 
</P>
<h3>One, Two and Three Dimensional Flows </h3>
<P >
The
term <B>one, two or three dimensional</B> flow refers to the number
of space coordinates required to describe the flow.  Any physical flow
is really three-dimensional, but using a full 3-D approach can be difficult
to calculate. Simplifications may be possible if there is no flow variation in one or more of the spacial dimensions. 
The maths is simplified by ignoring changes to flow and spacial components for those directions were flow properties
are remaining constant. It may be
possible to reduce a three-dimensional problem to a two-dimensional
one if flow is changing in only two directions or even a
one-dimensional case if only changes in the stream direction are significant.</P>
<center>
<IMG SRC="1d_flow.png" NAME="Picture 10" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=381 HEIGHT=189 BORDER=0><br><br>
<U>Figure 2 : Example of one-dimensional flow</U></center>
<p>Consider flow through a circular pipe. This flow is complex at the position
where the flow enters the pipe. But as we proceed downstream the flow
simplifies considerably and attains the state of a fully developed
flow. A characteristic of this flow is that the velocity becomes
invariant in the flow direction as shown in <i>Fig 2</i>. Velocity for this
flow is given by </P>
<p>
$$ u = u_{max}(1 - (r/R)^2) $$
</p>
<P >
Velocity at any location depends just on the radial distance <B>r
</B> from the centreline and is
independent of distance, <B>x</B>
or of the angular position <b>&theta;</b>.
This situation represents a typical <B>one-dimensional flow.</B> 
</P>
<P >
In comparison, flow through a diverging duct as shown in <i>Fig 3</i>. varies
in two directions. Velocity at any location depends not only upon the
radial distance <B>r</B>
but also on the <B>x</B>-distance.
This is therefore a <B>two-dimensional
flow</B>. 
</P>
<center>
<IMG SRC="2d_flow.png" NAME="Picture 15" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=284 HEIGHT=212 BORDER=0><br><br>
<U>Figure
3: Example of a two-dimensional flow</U></center>
<p>
The concept of a <b>uniform flow</B> as the boundary condition for analysing a fluid problem 
is very handy. A uniform flow is one where the velocity and other
properties are constant independent of directions. It is assumed that
at the boundaries of many problems, a uniform flow exists. E.g. at
the entrance to a pipe, far away from a aerofoil or a motor car as
shown in <i>Fig. 4</i>. 
</P>

<U>Figure 4 : Uniform Flow</U>
</center><p>
<h3>Flow Description, Streamline, Pathline, Streakline and Timeline </h3>
<P >
Streamline,
pathline, streakline and timeline form convenient tools to describe a
flow and visualise it. They are defined below. 
</P>
<center>
<IMG SRC="streamlines.png" NAME="Picture 17" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=401 HEIGHT=222 BORDER=0><BR>
<U>Figure 5 : Streamlines </U><br><br>
<IMG SRC="streamline_definition.png" NAME="Picture 18" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=348 HEIGHT=263 BORDER=0><BR><br>
<U>Figure 6: Streamline definition</U></center>
<p>A streamline is a line that is tangential to the velocity vector at
every point in the flow at a given instant of time.  This definition
leads to the equation for streamlines.</P>
<p>
$$ {du}/u={dv}/v={dw}/w $$
</p>
<P >
where <B>u,v,</B> and <B>w</B> are the velocity components in <B>x, y</B>
and <B>z</B> directions respectively.</P>
<center>
<IMG SRC="streamtube.png" NAME="Picture 20" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=253 HEIGHT=208 BORDER=0><br><br>
<U>Figure 7 : Streamtube</U>
</center>
<p>
Due to its definition, a streamline has no
flow across it; i.e. there is no flow normal to a streamline.
Sometimes a bundle of streamlines is considered together inside a
general flow for analysis. Such a bundle is called <B>stream
tube</B> . If a coordinate axis is
aligned along the stream tube then the flow in this axis system may be able to be analysed
as one-dimensional. 
</P>
<center>
<IMG SRC="pathlines.png" NAME="Picture 21" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=150 BORDER=0><br><br>
<U>Figure 8: Pathlines</U><br /><br />
<IMG SRC="streaklines.png" NAME="Picture 22" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=190 BORDER=0><br><br>
<U>Figure 9: Streaklines</U><br /><br />
<IMG SRC="timelines.png" NAME="Picture 23" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=136 BORDER=0><br><br>
<U>Figure 10: Timeline</U></center>
<p>
<B>Pathline</B>
is the line traced by a given particle. This is generated by
injecting a dye into the fluid and following its path by photography
or other means (<i>Fig.8</i>). <B>Streakline</B>
concentrates on fluid particles that have gone through a fixed
station or point. At some instant of time the position of all these
particles is marked and a line is drawn through them. Such a line is
called a streakline (<i>Fig.9</i>). <B>Timeline</B>
is generated by drawing a line through adjacent particles in flow at
any instant of time. (<i>Fig.10</i>).</P>
<P >
In
a steady flow the streamline, pathline and streakline all coincide.
In an unsteady flow they can be different. Streamlines are easily
generated mathematically while pathline and streaklines are obtained
through experiments. 
</P>
<h3>Eulerian
and Lagrangian approaches</h3>
<P >
Eulerian
and Lagrangian approaches are the two methods to study fluid motion.
The <B>Eulerian</B>
approach concentrates on fluid properties at a point <B>X(x,y,z,t)</B>.
Thus it is a field approach. In the <B>Lagrangian</B>
approach a particle or a group of particles is identified and
followed with time. This is a cumbersome method, but there may be
situations where it is unavoidable, such as in the two phase flow
involving particles. 
</P>
<h3>System
and Control Volume </h3>
<center>
<IMG SRC="piston.png" NAME="Picture 25" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=306 HEIGHT=161 BORDER=0><br><br>
<U>Figure 12 : Piston cylinder arrangement</U>
</CENTER>
<p>
The
term <B>system</B>
refers to a fixed mass with a boundary. With time the boundary of the
system may change, but the mass remains the same. An example is that
of a piston-cylinder arrangement as shown in <i>Fig.12</i>. A gas filled
cylinder is closed by a piston at the right hand end. The volume of 
gas is a <B>system</B>.
If the piston is now operated by pushing or pulling it the gas
compresses or expands. The boundary of the system moves, but the mass
does not cross the boundary as the system is a fixed mass. This
definition does not prevent work or energy crossing the boundary. 
</p>
<center>
<IMG SRC="complex_system.png" NAME="Picture 26" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=415 HEIGHT=212 BORDER=0><br><br>
<U>Figure 13 : Complex System Approach</U>
</CENTER>
<p>
It
is easy to analyse the system in the example of piston-cylinder
arrangement, but in fluid dynamics there are systems which are far
more complicated. For example, the flow about a moving vehicle. If a
system is defined by taking a volume of air at time <B>t<SUB>0</B></SUB>
then tracking this at various following points in time as the flow travels around the 
the vehicle, the system undergoes many changes as ilustrated in <i>Fig.
13</i>. The boundary changes rapidly and undergoes unmanageable
distortions. The system approach is extremely difficult. Other
complex examples are flow through turbomachinery, flow in hydraulic
systems, etc. 
</P>
<P >
Another
method is the <B>Control Volume, $&#650;$,</b>
approach. Here a &quot;window&quot; for observation of the flow is
established. This is the control volume shown in <i>Fig. 14</i>.  As
compared to a system, a control volume has a fixed boundary. Mass,
momentum and energy are allowed to cross the boundary. A
balance of mass, momentum and energy that flow across the boundary
and is caluclated and changes that take place to properties of flow within the control
volume can be calculated. The shape of the control volume does not
normally change. This is a more convenient approach and used for most
fluid dynamic analysis. 
</P>
<center>
<IMG SRC="control_volume.png" NAME="Picture 27" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=327 HEIGHT=211 BORDER=0><br><br>
<U>Figure 14 : Control Volume, $&#650;$</U>
</CENTER>
<p>
Most
problems consider the control volume to be fixed, but it is possible
to have control volumes that change their boundary and deform.  These
lead to more complicated solution equations. Examples of such control
volumes are shown in <i>Fig.15</i>. 
</P>
<center>
<IMG SRC="moving_cv.png" NAME="Picture 28" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=484 HEIGHT=174 BORDER=0><br><br>
<U>Figure 15 : Moving and Collapsible Control Volumes</U>
</CENTER>
<p>
The boundary of the control volume is referred to as <B>control
surface</B>. 
</P>
<P >
The
system and control volume approaches are akin to Lagrangian and Euler
approaches respectively. 
</P>
<h3>Differential and Integral Approachs </h3>
<P >The
<B>Differential</B>
approach aims to calculate flow at every point in a given flow field
in the form <B>X(x,y,z,t)</B>.
 To determine the flow about an object using this approach, the
properties of <b>&rho;,P, T, etc.</b>
are obtained everywhere within the region <B>R,</B>
as shown in <i>Fig.16</i>. From the detailed knowledge of the flow field it
is possible to predict features such as drag and lift. Flow around
objects is complicated and usually requires the solution of the
differential equations of motion. When geometry becomes complex, 
this approach becomes difficult
and calls for computational fluid dynamics methods to be used. 
</P>
<center>
<IMG SRC="approaches_to_calc.png" NAME="Picture 30" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=337 HEIGHT=115 BORDER=0><br><br>
<U>Figure 16: Differential and Integral approaches to calculate flow about an
Aerofoil.</U></center>
<p>
It is not always necessary to get a detailed set of information of the
flow. A large control volume can be created to encompass the region <B>R</B>
and calculate the overall features like drag and lift by studying
what happens at the boundary of the control volume, i.e., at the
control surface. This procedure is called the <B>Integral
approach</B>. 
</P>
<h3>
Integral Equations </h3>
<h3>
Basic Laws for Fluid Flow </h3>
<P >
There
are three simple laws governing fluid flow.  They are the
conservation laws for mass,  momentum and energy.  All fluid systems
are covered by these laws.</P>
<h3>
Conservation
of Mass </h3>
<P >
Consider a system of a fixed mass, <B>m</B>,
as shown in <i>Fig 17</i>. This mass does not change. The law of conservation
of mass can be stated as, 
</P>
$$ m_{system} = \text"constant" $$<br />
<center><IMG SRC="fig17_a_system.png" NAME="Object12" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE HSPACE=8 width=300>
<br />
<U>Figure 17: A System</U>
</CENTER>
<p>If mass is constant, then it does not change over time, so that,
<p>
$$ ( {dm}/{dt} )_{system} = 0 \text"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" m_{system} = &int;_{system} dm = &int;_{system} &rho;. d&#650; $$
</p>
<h3>
Newton's Second Law of Motion </h3>
<P >
Newton's
second law is the next one to be imposed upon fluid motion. It is
known that the rate of change of momentum is proportional to the
applied force. If <B>F</B>
is the force upon a system, 
</P>
<p>
$$ F ={dM}/{dt} $$
</p>
<P>
where
<B>M</B> is
the linear momentum. Here,</P>
<p>
$$ M = &int;_{system} V.dm = &int;_{system} V&rho;.d&#650; $$
</p>
<P >
Momentum<B>
M</B> and velocity <B>V</B>
are vectors and each has a component in each of the coordinate
directions. Accordingly, the above vector equation represents three
scalar equations. 
</P>
<P >
This
law is also true for angular momentum <b>(H)</b>. If a torque <B>T</B>
acts upon the system, then, 
</P>
<p>
$$ T = {dH}/{dt} $$ <br />
$$ H = &int;_{system} (r &times; V) .dm = &int;_{system} (r &times; V)&rho;.d&#650; $$
</p>
<P >
which again is a vector equation. Torque <B>T</B>
can be due to body forces and/or surface forces. In addition there
can also be torque directly introduced into the system such as 
through a mechanical shaft connected to the system. 
</P>
<h3>Conservation of Energy </h3>
<P>
The
first law of thermodynamics which is a statement of the conservation
of energy principle states, 
</P>
<p>
$$dQ-dW=dE$$<br />
$$\text"i.e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"{dQ}/{dt}-{dW}/{dt}={dE}/{dt}$$
</p>
<P >
where <B>dQ</B> is the heat added to the system, <B>dW</B>
is the work done by the system and <B>dE</B> is the consequent change in energy of the system.</P>
<P >
In addition, 
</P>
<p>
$$E_{system}= &int;_{system} e.dm = &int;_{system} e&rho;.d&#650; $$ 
</p>
<P >Energy (<B>e</B>) is a sum of internal energy (<B>u</B>),
kinetic energy (<b>KE</b>) and potential energy (<b>PE</b>). Thus 
</P>
<p>
$$e = u + V^2/2+gz$$
</p>
<H3>Second Law of Thermodynamics </H3>
<P>
While the first law of thermodynamics states that energy is conserved, the
second law establishes a direction in which a process can take place.
If <B>dS</B>
is the change in entropy and <B>dQ</B>
is the heat added and <B>T</B>
the temperature, 
</P>
<p>
$$ds&ge;{dQ}/T$$
</p>
<P >
In addition to the above relations we may need an equation of state, <b>P = P(&rho;,T)</b>.
</P>
<H3>Reynolds Transport Theorem</H3> 
<P >
The
method of applying these conservation laws in a control volume approach is
called the <B>Reynolds Transport Theorem</B>. 
</P><P>
Starting with a system and the rate at which an extensive property <B>N</B>
changes in it, this can be expressed in terms of a corresponding
intensive property, <b>&eta;</b>, associated with the control volume, which initially coincides with the system. 
</P>
<h3>Demonstration of the theorem for one-dimensional flow </h3>
<P >
Consider a stream tube in an one-dimensional flow. The flow takes
place entirely through the stream tube and there is no flow across
it, i.e., no flow in a direction normal to the stream tube. Consider the system <B>S</B>
in the flow.  A control volume <B>CV</B>
is defined coincident with <B>S</B> at time <B>t</B><SUB><B>0</B></SUB>
(<i>Fig.18</i>). The system has a fixed mass and is allowed to
move and deform. On the other hand the control volume has fixed a
boundary, which is denoted as <B>CS</B>.
In this analysis the <b>CV</b> is stationary. After the lapse of time <b>&Delta;t</b> 
i.e., at time <b>t<sub>0</sub>+&Delta;t</b>, the control volume remains at the same position, <B>I+II</B>
while the system has moved to occupy the new position <B>II + III</B>. During the time
interval mass contained in region <B>I</B>
has entered the control volume and mass in <B>III</B>
has left the control volume.

<p>
Consider an extensive property <B>N</B>
associated with the control volume. By definition we have,</P>
<p>
$${dN_s}/{dt} = lim_{&Delta;t&rarr;0}({N_s(t_0+&Delta;t)-N_s(t_0)}/{&Delta;t})$$

<U>Figure 19: General Control Volume and System</U>
</CENTER>
<p>
Whether
the flow at any small area of control surface is an inflow or an
outflow is decided by the direction of the velocity vector and that
of the area vector at that segment. For a small area $dA$ at the control surface (<i>Fig.19</i>), the velocity acting at that point will be 
$V&nwarr;{&rarr;}$.
The rate at which property <B>N</B> escapes or enters the control volume through $dA$ depends
upon the velocity component normal to $dA$, $V&nwarr;{&rarr;}&times;dA$.
In fact the rate of flow of <B>N</B>
through $dA$ is given by $&eta;&rho;V&nwarr;{&rarr;}&times;dA$. </P>
<P >
Integrating
this for the entire control surface gives the net rate of flow of <B>N</B>
into the control volume, $&int;_{cs} &eta;&rho;V&nwarr;{&rarr;}&times;dA$</P>
<P >
Consequently,
 the Reynolds Transport theorem for a general control volume can be
written as 
</P>
<p>
$${dN_s}/{dt}={&part;}/{dt}&int;_{cv} &eta;&rho;.d&#650; + &int;_{cs} &eta;&rho;V&nwarr;{&rarr;}&times;dA$$
</p>
<P >
This
equation can be simplified when specific control volumes are
considered. 
</P>
<h3>Conservation of Mass </h3>
<P >
The
Reynolds Transport theorem can be applied to derive an equation for
conservation of mass. We note that in the equation, <B>N</B>
is the extensive property of interest which now is mass <B>m</B>.
The corresponding intensive property is 
</P>
<p>
$$ &eta;=N/m=m/m=1 $$
</p>
<P >
Substitute
for <B>m</B>
and <b>&eta;</b> gives
</P>
<p>
$$ {dm}/{dt}={&part;}/{&part;t}&int;_{cv}&rho;.d&#650;+&int;_{cs}&rho;V&nwarr;{&rarr;} &times dA $$
</p>
<P >
By
definition, a system is an entity of fixed mass, the left hand side
of the above equation is zero, thus giving the equation for
conservation of mass as 
</P>
<p>
$$ {&part;}/{&part;t}&int;_{cv}&rho;.d&#650;+&int;_{cs}&rho;V&nwarr;{&rarr;} &times dA =0$$
</p>
<P >
which
expresses that the rate of accumulation of mass within a control
volume is equal to the net rate of flow of mass into the control
volume. This equation is also called the <B>Continuity
Equation.</B></P>
<h3>Steady Flow </h3>
<P >
For
a steady flow the time derivative in the equation vanishes. As a
result, 
</P>
<p>
$$ &int;_{cs}&rho;V&nwarr;{&rarr;} &times dA =0$$
</p>
<P >
In
addition if the flow is incompressible, <b>&rho;</b>=
constant and we have 
</P>
<p>
$$ &int;_{cs}V&nwarr;{&rarr;} &times dA =0$$
</p>
<h3>Incompressible Flow </h3>
<P >
The equation simplifies further when we consider an incompressible flow
where density <b>&rho;</b> is a constant. Consequently, 
</P>
<p>
$$ &rho;{&part;}/{&part;t}&int;_{cv}d&#650;+&rho;&int;_{cs}V&nwarr;{&rarr;} &times dA =0$$
</p>
<P >
Dividing by density, <b>&rho;</b>,
</P>
<p>
$$ {&part;}/{&part;t}&int;_{cv}d&#650;+&int;_{cs}V&nwarr;{&rarr;} &times dA =0$$
</p>
<P>
The first term is the rate of change of volume within a control volume,
which for a fixed control volume is zero by definition. This gives a
simple form of the equation for the conservation of mass for the
control volume as 
</P>
<p>
$$  &int;_{cs}V&nwarr;{&rarr;} &times dA =0$$
</p>
<P >
Thus for an incompressible flow the continuity equation is the same
irrespective of whether the flow is steady or unsteady. 
</P>
<h3>$V&nwarr;{&rarr;}&times; dA$</h3>
<P >
This <B>$V&nwarr;{&rarr;}&times; dA$</B>
term appears in almost all the equations for a control volume
analysis - mass, momentum and energy. Its sign convention must be
clearly defined. Consider any part of a control surface and let the
area be <B>dA</B>.
Let the velocity vector acting on it be <b>$V&nwarr;{&rarr;}$</b>.
We are interested in the velocity normal to the area that is
convecting the mass, momentum or energy. This is given by <b>$n&nwarr;{&rarr;}.V&nwarr;{&rarr;}$</b>.
Thus in scalar terms, 
</P>
<p>
$$ V&nwarr;{&rarr;}&times;dA = V \cos(&alpha;).dA $$
</p>
<P >
where <b>&alpha;</b> is the angle between area vector (normal to surface) and velocity
vector. 
</P>
<P >
A negative <b>$V&nwarr;{&rarr;}&times;dA$</b>
suggests an inflow into the control
volume while a positive <b>$V&nwarr;{&rarr;}&times;dA$</b>
is an outflow from the control volume. 
</P>
<h3>Application to a one-dimensional control volume </h3>
<P >
Consider an one-dimensional stream tube flow as shown in <i>Fig.20</i>. The control volume is bounded by surface <B>1</B>, an inlet, 
and surface <B>2</B>, an outlet and the connecting streamtube <b>S</b> through which there is no flow.
There is  inflow/outflow of mass only through the two labelled surfaces.

and <B>V<SUB>2</B></SUB>
and areas
of cross section, <B>A<SUB>1</B></SUB>

$$ &int;_{cs}&rho;V&nwarr;{&rarr;}&times;dA=&int;_{1}&rho;V\cos(180).dA+&int;_{2}&rho;V\cos(0).dA=-&int;_{1}&rho;V.dA+&int;_{2}&rho;V.dA=0 $$

<P>
as flow properties are constant over the areas this simplifies to 
</P>
<p>
$$&rho;_{1}V_{1}A_{1}=&rho;_{2}V_{2}A_{2} $$</p>
<h3>Momentum Equation </h3> 
<P >
A momentum equation resulting from the Reynolds Transport theorem can
also be derived. Now, <b>$N=M&nwarr;{&rarr;}$</b> where <b>$M&nwarr;{&rarr;}$</b> is
the momentum. Note that momentum is a vector quantity and that it has
a component in every coordinate direction. Thus, 
</P>
<p>
$$ N=M \text"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&eta;={M&nwarr;{&rarr;}}/m=V&nwarr;{&rarr;} $$
</p>
<P >
Consider
the left hand side of Reynolds Transport equation. ${dM&nwarr;{&rarr;}}/{dt}$
is proportional to the applied force as per Newton's Second Law of
motion. Thus, 
</P>
<p>
$${dM&nwarr;{&rarr;}}/{dt}=F&nwarr;{&rarr;}$$
</p>
<P >
Where <b>$F&nwarr;{&rarr;}$</b> is again a vector and
includes both body forces, <b>$F_B&nwarr;{&rarr;}$</b> and
surface forces, <b>$F_S&nwarr;{&rarr;}$</b>. 
Thus, 
</P>
<p>
$${dM&nwarr;{&rarr;}}/{dt}=F_B&nwarr;{&rarr;}+F_S&nwarr;{&rarr;} $$
</p>
<P >
Now
substitute for <b>&eta;</b> in the right hand side of the equation giving, 
</P>
<p>
$$F_B&nwarr;{&rarr;}+F_S&nwarr;{&rarr;}={&part;}/{&part;t}&int;_{cv}&rho;V&nwarr;{&rarr;}.d&#650;+&int;_{cs}V&nwarr;{&rarr;}&rho;V&nwarr;{&rarr;} &times;dA $$
</p>
<P >
Writing
this as three equations, one for each coordinate direction, 
</P>
<p>
\[\table F_{Bx}&nwarr;{&rarr;}+F_{Sx}&nwarr;{&rarr;}= {&part;}/{&part;t}&int;_{cv}&rho;u.d&#650;+&int;_{cs}u&rho;V&nwarr;{&rarr;}&times;dA ;
         F_{By}&nwarr;{&rarr;}+F_{Sy}&nwarr;{&rarr;}= {&part;}/{&part;t}&int;_{cv}&rho;v.d&#650;+&int;_{cs}v&rho;V&nwarr;{&rarr;}&times;dA ;
         F_{Bz}&nwarr;{&rarr;}+F_{Sz}&nwarr;{&rarr;}= {&part;}/{&part;t}&int;_{cv}&rho;w.d&#650;+&int;_{cs}w&rho;V&nwarr;{&rarr;}&times;dA ;\]
</p>
<P >
The
term $u&rho;V&nwarr;{&rarr;}&times;dA$ represents
the <B>u</B> momentum that is convected in/out through the surface <b>dA</b> 
in a direction normal to it. In fact momentum in other directions can
also be convected out from the same area. These are given by $v&rho;V&nwarr;{&rarr;}&times;dA$ and $w&rho;V&nwarr;{&rarr;}&times;dA$.</P>
<P >
As stated before the term $&rho;V&nwarr;{&rarr;}&times;dA$ is replaced by $&rho;V\cos(&alpha;).dA$ to account for the 
angle between the normal to the surface and the direction of the flow. 
This equation set is used in numerous applications in fluid dynamics, such
as force at the bending of a pipe, thrust developed at the foundation
of a rocket nozzle, drag about an immersed body etc.</P>
<h3>Bernoulli Equation </h3>
<P >
The momentum equation leads to the development of the <B>Bernoulli
Equation</B>, named after Bernoulli
(1738). This equation basically connects pressure at any point in
flow with velocity. It is one of the widely used equations in fluid
dynamics to calculate pressure with the knowledge of velocity. 
</P>
<P >
A differential stream tube within a flow with a defined small control volume
within it is shown in <i>Fig.21</i>.  Any flow takes place only along the
streamtube and through the ends of it. The flow is therefore one
dimensional in nature and takes places in a direction <B>s</B>
along the stream tube. Accordingly, the velocity is denoted by <B>V<SUB>s</B></SUB>.
There is no flow across the tube. The length of the stream tube
is <B>ds</B>.
</P>

</CENTER>
<p>
Since it is a small stream tube any property changes only vary slightly
in direction <b>s</b>. The area, velocity, density and pressure at the left
hand end i.e., the inlet end, (<b>1</b>) are set as  
<b>A, V<sub>s</sub>, &rho;</b> and <b>P</b>. Assuming the flow is incompressible, then at outlet end (<b>2</b>), the corresponding properties will be
<b>A+dA, V<sub>s</sub>+dV<sub>s</sub>, &rho;+d&rho;</b> and <b>P+dP</b>.</P>
<P >
Applying the momentum equation to the above differential control volume will
provide a detailed solution to the problem.  First a list of the
assumptions made is required. 
</P>
<P ><B>Assumptions</B>
<OL>
 <LI> A stream tube with no cross flow considered.</li>
 <LI> The flow is steady, ${&part;}/{&part;t}=0$</li>
 <LI> Fluid is incompressible ( <b>&rho;</b> = constant,  <b>d&rho; = 0</b>).</li>
</OL></p>
<P >
Any application of the momentum equation should be preceded by the
Continuity Equation. Complete information about the flow cannot be
obtained by applying the momentum equation alone. 
</P>
<h3>Application of Continuity Equation </h3>
<p>
$${&part;}/{&part;t}&int;_{cv}&rho;.d&#650;+&int;_{cs}&rho;V_s&nwarr;{&rarr;}&times;dA=0 $$
</p>
<P >
The first term in the equation cancels out because of the steady flow
assumption. Since all the flow takes place through surfaces (<b>1</b>) and (<b>2</b>)
the remaining term reduces to 
</P>
<p>
$$-&rho;V_sA+&rho;(V_s+dV_s)(A+dA)=0$$
</p>
<P>giving</P>
<p>
$$&rho;(V_s+dV)(A+dA)=&rho;V_sA={dm}/{dt}$$
</p>
<P >
where ${dm}/{dt}$ is
the mass flow rate through the control volume.</P>
<h3>Application of Momentum Equation </h3>
<P >
From the momentum equation, 
</P>
<p>
$$F_{Bs}&nwarr;{&rarr;}+F_{Ss}&nwarr;{&rarr;}={&part;}/{&part;t}&int;_{cv}V_s.d&#650;+&int;_{cs}V_s&rho;V_s&nwarr;{&rarr;}&times;dA$$
</p>
<P >
Since
the flow is steady, the first term on the RHS drops out. Body forces <b>F<sub>Bs</sub></b> and surface forces <b>F<sub>Ss</sub></b>
 acting on the control volume need to be evaluated. 
</P>
<h3>Body Forces</h3>
<P >The only body force acting is the weight of the fluid within the control
volume. Accordingly, in the <B>s</B> direction, 
</P>
<p>
\[\table F_{Bs}, =,-dW \sin(&theta;);
               , =,-(dm)g \sin(&theta;);
               , =,-(&rho;d&#650;)g \sin(&theta;);
               , =,-(&rho;ds(A+{dA}/2))g \sin(&theta;);
               , =,-&rho;g(A+{dA}/2)dz;
         F_{Bs}, =,-&rho;gAdz \]
</p>
<h3>Surface Forces</h3> 
<P >
The surface force is due to pressure acting upon the boundaries of the
control surface. There are three terms that contribute - end (<b>1</b>), end
(<b>2</b>) and the bounding surface of the stream tube. Force on each of
these is given by the product of pressure and area. For the bounding
surface this force is the product of an average pressure, $1/2(P+(P+dP))=P+{dP}/2$
multiplied by the effective area, <B>dA</B>.
Thus for the surface forces,</P>
<p>
\[\table F_{Ss}, =, PA-(P+dP)(A+dA)+(P+{dP}/2)dA;
               , =, PA-PA-PdA-AdP-dPdA+PdA+{dP}/2dA;
               , =, -AdP - {dPdA}/2;
         F_{Ss}, =, -AdP \]

substituting for <B>&rho;(A+dA)(V<SUB>s</SUB>+dV<sub>s</sub>)</b> from continuity, RHS = 
</P>
<p>
$$-V_s&rho;AV_s+(V_s+dV_s)&rho;AV_s = &rho;AV_sdV_s$$
</p>
<P >
Now equating terms from the LHS and RHS, 
</P>
<p>
$$&rho;AV_sdV_s=-&rho;gA{dz}- A{dP} $$
</p>
<P >
i.e.,</p><p>
$$V_sdV_s+ gdz+{dP}/&rho;=0$$
</p>
<P >
i.e.,</p><p>
$$d({V_s^2}/2)+gdz+{dP}/&rho;=0$$</p>
<P >
The above equation is readily integrated for an incompressible flow ( <b>&rho;</b> = constant). As a result, 
</P>
<p>
$$P/&rho;+{V_s^2}/2+gz = \text"constant"$$
</p>
<P>
This equation is called the Bernoulli Equation. Note that it connects
pressure (<B>P</B>), elevation (<B>z</B>) and velocity (<B>V</B><SUB><B>s</B></SUB>).
 The equation is valid along a streamline and we can drop the subscript <B>s</B>
as velocity is always in the direction of local streamlines. This gives, 
</P>
<p>
$$P/&rho;+{V^2}/2+gz = \text"constant"$$
</p>
<P >
This
equation is valid for steady flows only in absence of any friction
such as forces due to viscosity and the flow must  be
incompressible. 
</P>
<h3>Application to moving Control Volumes </h3>
<P >
The continuity and the momentum equations can be extended to cases where
the control volume is not fixed in space. One such case is when the
control volume is moving with a constant velocity, say an aircraft
or a ship moving at a constant speed. Note that the equations derived
assume that the speeds are all referred to the control volume. So it
becomes a simple matter to consider a control volume moving at a
constant speed, <B>V</B><SUB><B>cv</B></SUB>.
Define 
</P>
<p>
$$V_{rel}=V-V_{cv}$$
</p>
<P >
which
now is the speed relative to the control volume. The equation for
Reynolds Transport theorem,  gets altered to</P>
<p>
$$ {dN_s}/{dt}={&part;}/{&part;t}&int;_{cv}&eta;&rho;.d&#650;+&int;_{cs}&eta;&rho;V_{rel}&nwarr;{&rarr;} &times;dA$$
</p>
<h3>Equation for Angular Momentum </h3>
<P >
Many flow devices and turbo-machinery involve rotating components.
Examples are Centrifugal pumps, Turbines and Compressors. The
analysis of such systems is facilitated by the Reynolds Transport
theorem written for angular momentum. 
</P>
<p>
$$T={dH}/{dt}$$
</p>
<P >
where,</P>
<p>
$$ H=&int;_{system}(r&nwarr;{&rarr;} &times;V&nwarr;{&rarr;}).dm=&int;_{system}(r&nwarr;{&rarr;}&times;V&nwarr;{&rarr;})&rho;.d&#650;$$
</p>
<P >
It becomes necessary now to calculate the angular momentum about some
point, say <B>O</B>.
Then, 
</P>
<p>
$$N=H_O\text"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&eta;={dH_O}/{dm}=r&nwarr;{&rarr;}&times;V&nwarr;{&rarr;}$$
</p>
<P >
Substitution
into the equation for Reynolds theorem gives, 
</P>
<p>
$${dH_{Os}}/{dt}={&part;}/{&part;t}&int;_{cv}(r&nwarr;{&rarr;}&times;V&nwarr;{&rarr;})&rho;.d&#650;+&int;_{cs}(r&nwarr;{&rarr;}&times;V&nwarr;{&rarr;})&rho;V&nwarr;{&rarr;}&times;dA$$
</p>
<P >
The LHS of the above equation is the sum of all the moments about the
point <B>O</B>,
ie. $&Sigma;(r&nwarr;{&rarr;}&times;F&nwarr;{&rarr;})$. Accordingly, 
</P>
<p>
$$&Sigma;(r&nwarr;{&rarr;}&times;F&nwarr;{&rarr;})={&part;}/{&part;t}&int;_{cv}(r&nwarr;{&rarr;}&times;V&nwarr;{&rarr;})&rho;.d&#650;+&int;_{cs}(r&nwarr;{&rarr;}&times;V&nwarr;{&rarr;})&rho;V&nwarr;{&rarr;}&times;dA$$
</p>
<h3>Deformable
Control Volumes and Control Volumes with non-inertial acceleration </h3>
<P >
It is possible to extend this analysis to the general cases of
deformable control volumes and those that undergo acceleration, but
these are beyond the scope of this text.</P>
<h3>Energy Equation </h3>
<P >
The Reynolds Transport theorem can also be used to derive an equation for
energy conservation in a control volume. Now, 
</P>
<p>
$$N=E\text"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&eta;=E/m=e$$
</p>
<P >
On the LHS we have ${dE}/{dt}$,
which from the First Law of Thermodynamics is 
</P>
<p>
$${dE}/{dt}={dQ}/{dt}-{dW}/{dt}$$
</p>
<P >
Where ${dQ}/{dt}$ is
the rate at which heat is added to the system and ${dW}/{dt}$ is
the rate at which work is done on/by the system. 
</P>
<P >
Substituting,
</P>
<p>
$${dQ}/{dt}-{dW}/{dt}={&part;}/{&part;t}&int;_{cv}e&rho;.d&#650;+&int;_{cs}e&rho;V&nwarr;{&rarr;}&times;dA$$
</p>
<P >
In the above equation, <B>e</B>
should include all forms of energy - internal, potential, kinetic and
others. The <I>others</I>
category will include nuclear, electromagnetic and other sources of
energy.  For simple fluid flows these are not important. Fields such
as Magneto Hydrodynamics and Relativistic Fluid Dynamics will involve
these additional forms of energy.</P>
<P >
For
simple fluids, 
</P>
<p>
$$e=u+gz+1/2V^2$$
</p>
<P >
There are different modes of performing work - shaft work, <B>W</B><SUB><B>s</B></SUB>,
work done by pressure, <B>W</B><SUB><B>p</B></SUB>
, and work due to shear forces on the control surface. Shaft work
includes any work that is directly added to the system by means of a
pump, piston etc. Work done by pressure is calculated as 
</p>
<p>
$$d({dW}/{dt})=-PdAV_n=PV.dA$$
</p>
<P >
where
<B>dA</B>
is an elemental area over the control surface, the velocity <B>V</B><SUB><B>n</B></SUB>
is assumed to be directed into the control volume (hence gets a
negative sign). This equation is integrated over the control surface
to obtain the total work due to pressure. Thus, 
</P>
<p>
$${dW_P}/{dt}=&int;_{cs}PV&nwarr;{&rarr;}&times;dA$$
</p>
<P >
Work due to shear forces is small and is usually neglected. Heat added ${dQ}/{dt}$ becomes important only in problems involving heat transfer. Upon
substituting for various terms, 
</P>
<p>
\[\table {dQ}/{dt}-{dW_s}/{dt}-{dW_P}/{dt}, =,{&part;}/{&part;t}&int;_{cv}(u+gz+1/2V^2)&rho;.d&#650;+&int;_{cs}(u+gz+1/2V^2)&rho;V&nwarr;{&rarr;}&times;dA;
         {dQ}/{dt}-{dW_s}/{dt}-&int;_{cs}PV&nwarr;{&rarr;}&times;dA, =,{&part;}/{&part;t}&int;_{cv}(u+gz+1/2V^2)&rho;.d&#650;+&int;_{cs}(u+gz+1/2V^2)&rho;V&nwarr;{&rarr;}&times;dA;
         {dQ}/{dt}-{dW_s}/{dt}, =,{&part;}/{&part;t}&int;_{cv}(u+gz+1/2V^2)&rho;.d&#650;+&int;_{cs}(u+gz+1/2V^2+P/&rho;)&rho;V&nwarr;{&rarr;}&times;dA;
                              , =,{&part;}/{&part;t}&int;_{cv}(u+gz+1/2V^2)&rho;.d&#650;+&int;_{cs}(h+gz+1/2V^2)&rho;V&nwarr;{&rarr;}&times;dA;\]
</p>
<P >
where
<B>h</B> is
specific enthalpy given by $u+P/&rho;$. The final equation is the general form of the Energy Equation for a
control volume.

<h3>Energy equation for a one-dimensional control volume </h3>

<p>
Consider the one-dimensional control volume shown in <i>Fig 22</i>. The velocity,
density, pressure and other variables are assumed to be uniform
across the ends,</P>

$${dQ}/{dt}-{dW}/{dt}=-{(&rho;AV)}_1{(h+gz+1/2V^2)}_1+{(&rho;AV)}_2{(h+gz+1/2V^2)}_2$$
</center><P >
Note that for continuity, 
$(&rho;AV)_1=(&rho;AV)_2={dm}/{dt}$</P>
<p>
$${dQ}/{dt}-{dW}/{dt}=-{dm}/{dt}{(h+gz+1/2V^2)}_1+{dm}/{dt}{(h+gz+1/2V^2)}_2$$

</P>
<p>
$${(h+gz+1/2V^2)}_1={(h+gz+1/2V^2)}_2 - q + w_s $$
</p>
<P >
Note that the term $(h+gz+1/2V^2)$ is equal to the Total Enthalpy denoted by <B>H</B><SUB><B>0</B></SUB>.
Accordingly the equation becomes</P>
<p>
$$H_{O1}=H_{O2}-q+w_s$$</p>
<P >
The total enthalpy of a control volume is conserved unless heat or work
is added to or taken out of the control volume. 
</P>
<h3>Low Speed Application </h3>
<P >
In low speed applications, it is usual to express energy as a <B>Head</B>,
with each of the terms in the above equation having the units of a
length.
This is done by dividing the equation throughout by <B>g</B>.
Thus, 
</P>
<p>
$${(u/g+P/{&rho;g}+z+V^2/{2g})}_1={(u/g+P/{&rho;g}+z+V^2/{2g})}_2-q/g+{w_s}/g$$
</p>
<P >
or</P>
<p>
$${(u/g+P/&gamma;+z+V^2/{2g})}_1={(u/g+P/&gamma;+z+V^2/{2g})}_2-h_q+h_s$$
</p>
<P >
The term $P/&gamma;$ is
called the <B>Pressure Head</B>
and $V^2/{2g}$ the<b>
Velocity Head</B>. Terms<B>
h</B><SUB><B>q</B></SUB>
and <B>h</B><SUB><B>s</B></SUB>
represent the heat added and shaft work converted to &quot;<B>head</B>&quot;
units. 
</P>
<p>
If we consider a simple pipe flow without the shaft work then the
equation becomes 
</P>
<p>
$${(P/&gamma;+z+V^2/{2g})}_1={(P/&gamma;+z+V^2/{2g})}_2+{u_2-u_1-q}/g_s$$
</p>
<P >
The terms within the parenthesis are called the <B>Total
Head</B> or <B>Available
Head</B>. Normally in a flow some
available head is lost because of friction and heat transfer. It is a
common practice to use the above equation in the following form, 
</P>
<p>
$${(P/&gamma;+z+V^2/{2g})}_1={(P/&gamma;+z+V^2/{2g})}_2-h_{friction}-h_{pump}+h_{turbine}$$
</p>
<P >
The losses that take place between &quot;inlet&quot; i.e., (1) and
&quot;outlet&quot; i.e., (2) are obtained through measurements and
imperical correlations. 
</P>
<h3>Relationship between Energy Equation and Bernoulli Equation </h3>
<P >
An examination of these equations brings out the connection between the
Energy equation and the Bernoulli equation. It is clear that two
equations become one when losses that occur between (1) and (2) are
ignored. 
</P>
<P >
Bernoulli
Equation can be used only when considering a frictionless flow along
a streamline. Further it is required that the flow be incompressible
without any addition of heat or shaft work. 
</P>
<h3 >Bernoulli Equation for Aerodynamic Flow </h3>
<P >
In aerodynamics,  considerably higher speeds are dealt with.  An
aircraft flies at speeds of the order of 500 kmph and more, while
river flows or household pipe flows may only involve 10 kmph or so.
Consequently, the kinetic energy term for aerodynamic flows is very
large when compared to the potential energy. Accordingly, it is usual
to neglect potential energy for such flows. The Bernoulli Equation as
a consequence becomes, 
</P>
<p>
$$P+1/2&rho;V^2=\text"constant"$$
</p>
<h3>
Stagnation
Pressure </h3>

<U>Figure 23 : Stagnation Point on (a) Simple Body and (b) a complicated Body </U>
</center>
<p>The Bernoulli equation can be applied to flow about a body such as an
aircraft as shown in <i>Fig 23</i>.  Let <B>1-s</B>
be a streamline that passes through the stagnation point of the flow,
i.e., the point where the flow is brought to rest or where the
velocity is zero. Assuming constant density and no losses then
applying the Bernoulli equation along <B>1-s</B>
gives, 
</P>
<p>
$$P_1+1/2&rho;V_1^2=P_2+1/2&rho;V_2^2=\text" ... "=P_s+1/2&rho;V_s^2$$
</p>
<P >
where
<B>P</B><SUB><B>s</B></SUB>
and<B> V</B><SUB><B>s</B></SUB>
are the pressure and velocity at the point <B>s</B>.
It is known that <B>V</B><SUB><B>s</B></SUB><B>=
0</B>. Therefore, 
</P>
<p>
$$P_1+1/2&rho;V_1^2=P_2+1/2&rho;V_2^2=\text" ... "=P_s$$
</p>
<P >
<B>P</B><SUB><B>s</B></SUB>
is referred to as <B>Stagnation
Pressure.</B>  It is the maximum
pressure experienced by the fluid. It becomes a very convenient
constant for the Bernoulli Equation for aerodynamics flows. It is the
pressure experienced by the fluid when it is brought to rest. The
kinetic energy of the upstream fluid is converted into pressure as a
consequence of the fluid being brought to rest. 
</P>
<P >
The
term &quot;<B>P</B>&quot;
is the pressure seen by the moving fluid and is referred to as <B>Static
Pressure. </B>
</P>
<h3>Energy Grade Line </h3>
<P >
Terms <B>Energy Grade Line</B>
and <B>Hydraulic Grade Line</B>
are frequently used by hydraulic engineers. Each of the terms of the
Bernoulli equation can be expressed as a head. In absence of work and
heat transfer,</P>
<p>
$$z_1+{P_1}/&gamma;+{V_1^2}/{2g}=z_2+{P_2}/&gamma;+{V_2^2}/{2g}=\text" ... "=H$$
</p>
<P>
where
term <B>H</B> is not to be mistaken for enthalpy and is to be taken as the <B>total
head</B>. If the above equation is
graphed,  the total energy value is a constant and represented by a
horizontal line as shown in <i>Fig 24</i> and is called the <B>Energy
Grade Line</B>. One other line that is defined is the<B> Hydraulic Grade Line,</B>
which is the Energy Grade Line subtracting the velocity head (i.e.,
<B>V</B><SUP><B>2</B></SUP><B>/2g</B>).
</P>
<center>
<IMG SRC="energy_grade_line.png" NAME="Picture 224" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=389 HEIGHT=305 BORDER=0><br><br>
<U>Figure 24: Energy Grade Line (EGL) and Hydraulic Grade Line (HGL) for an
one-dimensional flow. </U>
</CENTER>
<p>
If the losses are taken into account the EGL will drop accordingly. Any
work extraction along the path, such as via a turbine, will be seen
as a sudden drop in the EGL. Any work addition will be reflected as a
sharp rise. HGL follows similar trends. 
</P>
<h3>Kinetic Energy Correction Factor </h3>
<P >
It is assumed in the derivation of Bernoulli equation that the velocity
at the end sections (1) and (2) is uniform,  but in practical
situations this may not be the case and the velocity can vary across
the inlet or exit cross sections. A solution for handling this
additional complexity  is to use a correction factor for the kinetic
energy term in the equation. If $V_{avg}$ is the average velocity at an end section then, for energy, 
</P>
<p>
$$&int;_A {V^2}/2&rho;V.dA=&alpha;{dm}/{dt}{V_{avg}^2}/2$$
</p>
<P >
After simplification,</P>
<p>
$$&alpha;=1/A&int;_A{(u/V_{avg})}^3 .dA$$
</p><P >
Consequently,
</P>
<p>
$${(P/&gamma;+z+&alpha;_1 V^2/{2g})}_1={(P/&gamma;+z+&alpha;_2 V^2/{2g})}_2-h_{friction}-h_{pump}+h_{turbine}$$
</p>
<P >
where <b>&alpha;</b> is
the <B>Kinetic Energy Factor</B>.
Its value for a fully developed laminar pipe flow is around <B>2</B>,
whereas for a turbulent pipe flow it is between <B>1.04</B>
to <B>1.11.</B>
It is usual to take it is <B>1</B>
for a turbulent flow. It should not be neglected for a laminar flow.</P>
