<h3>Properties
of Fluids</h3>
<P>
Fluids occur in familiar, everyday items. They surround us as an atmosphere and oceans. Our body itself is mostly water. 
In fact, Greeks and Indians in the long distant past worshiped earth, fire, water and air; three of these
being fluids. Motion of these fluids can be found almost everywhere- inside
the human body, in our day-to-day activities such as taking a shower, cleaning,
swimming etc. Flying and sailing are nothing more than the motion of an
object through a fluid. <b>Fluid mechanics</b> is the science of the study of the
behaviour of fluids and their effect on other bodies. It comprises of
<B>fluid statics</B>,
which is a study of fluids at rest and <B>fluid
dynamics</B>, which concerns fluids in
motion. Fluids can also be classied further as <B>aerodynamics</B>,
which specialises in flow of air, or 
<B>hydrostatics</B> and <B>hydrodynamics</B>, which specialise in the flow of water.

&nbsp;<br /><u>Three
Approaches to Fluid Mechanics</u>
</center>
<P><br /></p><p>
There are three approaches to fluid mechanics : <B>experimental,
theoretical and computational. </B>
</P>
<P >
The <b>experimental</b>
approach is the oldest one. It is a very popular approach
where measurements are made using wind tunnels, water channels or similar
equipment. Experiments are costly ventures and are becoming costlier day
by day.</P>
<P >
Then there is the
<b>theoretical</b> approach where mathematical equations are employed that
govern the flow and can capture the fluid behaviour within a
closed form solution i.e., formulas that can be readily used. This is
perhaps the simplest of the approaches, but its scope is somewhat
limited. Not every fluid flow renders itself to an easy investigation. The
resulting equations may be too complicated to solve directly. 
</P>
<P >
Then comes the third approach, <b>computational</b>. In this approach
 complicated governing equations are solved by computing techniques using modern software algorithms.
This has the advantage that a wide variety of fluid flows may be
computed and that the cost of computing seems to be going down day by
day. The emerging discipline of <B>Computational
Fluid Dynamics, CFD,</B> has become a very powerful approach today in industry and research. 
It is worth noting however, that any theoretical calculation or numerical computation
has to be validated. For this it is usual to rely on experiments.
Theory guides and experiment decides. 
</P>
<P >
In this site, the theoretical approach is the main focus as it gives a good
insight into fluid mechanics. On occasion reference will be made to 
information provided by experimental studies and computational
techniques. The development of the detailed CFD techniques is outside the scope of this work. 
</P>
<h2>What is a Fluid?</h2>
<p>
It is well known
that matter is divided into solids and fluids. Fluids can be further
divided into Liquids and Gases. Solids have a definite shape and a definite size, 
while liquids have a definite size or volume, but no definite shape. They assume the
shape of the container they are poured into. Gases, on the other hand may
have neither a shape nor a size. They can fill any container fully
and assume its shape. A more precise
definition can be obtained by considering the properties of these materials. 
The response of a solid or a fluid to a shear force with define the difference. 
A solid resists a shear force while a fluid deforms continuously under the action of a shear force.</P>
<center>
<IMG SRC="solid_fluid_deformation.png" NAME="graphics1" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=410 HEIGHT=146 BORDER=0><BR>
<U>Figure 1.
Deformation of a Solid </U>
</center>
<p>
Consider
two flat plates of infinite length placed a distance <B>h</B>
apart as shown in <i>Fig 1</i>. The lower plate is fixed while the upper
plate is allowed to move. The gap in between the plates is initially
filled with a solid substance. If now a shear force is applied to the
upper plate, the solid block deforms as shown. Line <B>ab</B>
assumes a new position <B>a'b'</B> and
the upper plate is displaced by a distance <B>bb'</B>.
The deformation produced is proportional to the applied shear stress
<B>F/A</B>,
where <B>A </B>is
the area of the solid surface in contact with the plate. 
</P>
<center>
<IMG SRC="fluid_deformation.png" NAME="graphics3" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=602 HEIGHT=101 BORDER=0><br /><U>Figure
2. Deformation of a Fluid.</U></center>
<p>
If the gap is filled with a fluid, when a shear force is applied to the top of the plate, 
it moves continuously ie., point <b>b</b> keeps moving and occupies positions <B>b1,
b2, b3, </B>etc at different instants of time. The fluid block between the plates deforms and continues to
deform as long as the force is applied. This experiment shows that a
fluid at rest cannot resist shear stress. Such an experiment also
can be used to define viscosity. 
</P>
<h3>Continuum
Hypothesis</h3>
<P >
It is well known that all matter is made up of molecules, 
which are in random motion. Any fluid can be considered as having molecules bombarding each other and the
boundaries, i.e. the walls of the container. There is no guarantee
whatever that molecules are present at a specific point at a given instant
of time, but it is still possible to define the fluid velocity at a point.
Velocity or density or any other fluid properties at a point can be defined in an average sense. That is, as
an average of velocities (or densities) of the molecules that pass
through a small volume surrounding that point. The size of this small
volume has to meet with certain criteria. It must be smaller than the
physical dimensions of the region under consideration, like the wing
of an aircraft or the pipe in a hydraulic system. At the same time it
must be of sufficient size to accommodate a large number of molecules
to make any averaging meaningful. There is a lower
limit to the size of this volume. 
</P>
<P>
The existence of this limit is established by considering the definition of density as
mass per unit volume (<b>&Delta;m/&Delta;V</b>). Consider a small volume <b>&Delta;V</b> around
the point (<b>P</b>, <i>Fig. 3</i>) within the region of interest, <B>R</B>. 
The density at <B>P</B> can be evaluated by considering different sizes of <b>&Delta;V</b>.
Values of density for the different volumes are plotted in the same figure. It is
clear that the size <b>&Delta;V</b> has
an influence on the calculated value of density. Too small
a <b>&Delta;V</b>, the value fluctuates because the small number of
molecules within the volume varies significantly with time. Too big a <b>&Delta;V</b>
 might mean that density variation in the regioin of interest is not identified.
It is clear that there is a limit <b>&Delta;V<sub>0</sub></b>
 below which molecular variations assume importance and above which one
finds a macroscopic variation of density within the region.</P>
<center><IMG SRC="volume.png" WIDTH="500" BORDER=0><br />
<U>Figure 3: Definition of Density </U>
</center>
<p>
Therefore it
appears that density is best defined as a limit,</p>
<p>
$$&rho;=lim_{\&Delta;V&rarr;0}({&Delta;m}/{&Delta;V})$$
</p><p>
At standard temperature and pressure conditions (STP) the limit (<b>&Delta;V<sub>0</sub></b>)
is around <B>10<SUP>-9</SUP>mm<SUP>3</B></SUP>
for air.  This tiny volume has about <B>3 x 10<SUP>7</B></SUP>
molecules. This is a large enough number to give a constant
value of density despite the rigorous molecular motion within it. For
many of the applications in fluid mechanics, this minimum volume is much smaller
than the overall dimensions of the regions of interest considered, e.g.
an aircraft winge,  a ship or the parts of an engine etc. These considerations start to break down when 
much greater altitudes are considered. For example, at an altitude of <B>130
km</B> the molecular mean free path is about <B>10.2 m</B>
and there are only <B>1.6 x 10<SUP>17</B></SUP>
molecules in a cubic meter of air. Molecular mean free path, &lambda; is
defined as the average distance a molecule has to travel before it
collides with another molecule. At STP conditions its value is <B>6
x 10<SUP>-8</SUP>
m</B> . Under lower density conditions it
becomes necessary to consider the effect of every molecule or groups
of molecules, as in calculations concerning re-entry vehicles. That
branch of fluid mechanics is called <b>Rarefied
Gasdynamics</b> and is again outside the scope of this chapter.</P>
<h3>Viscosity, &mu;</h3>
<P >
The more viscous a fluid is, the more sticky it is and the
more difficult for it to flow. Oils flow at a slower rate than water.
Viscosity is a fluid property that tends to retard fluid
motion. A more rigorous definition of viscosity can be developed using the experiment mentioned above. 
</P>
<center>
<IMG SRC="plates.png" NAME="Picture 19" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=392 HEIGHT=160 BORDER=0>
<br><u>Figure 4: Flow between parallel plates</u></center>
<p>
It
was seen that when a shear force is applied to the top plate the
fluid undergoes a continuous deformation (<i>Fig.2</i>). As a result the
block of fluid <I><B>abcd</B></I>
deforms to <I><B>ab'c'd</B></I>
after a time <b>&Delta;t</b>. If the speed of the top plate is <B>U</B> then the layer of fluid
adjacent to a solid surface moves with the same velocity. This is called the <b>&quot;No Slip&quot;</b> condition.
Accordingly, the fluid layer closer to the top plate moves with a speed <B>U</B>
while that closer to the lower plate is at rest. Thus the velocity of
the fluid varies continuously from zero on the lower plate to <B>U</B>
at the upper plate. In other words, a velocity gradient develops in
the fluid. In the simple case of the flow between parallel plates
this is a linear profile. The velocity gradient is given by 
</P>
<p>
$${du}/{dy}=U/h$$
</p>
<P>
where
<B>h</B> is
the distance between the two plates. 
</P>
<P>
In a small instant of time <b>&Delta;t</b> the upper plate has moved by a distance <I><B>bb'</B></I>
which is equal to <b>U.&Delta;t</b>.</P>
<P>
Now</P>
<p>
$$tan(&Delta;&alpha;)&asymp;&Delta;&alpha;={U &Delta;t}/h$$
</p>
<P>
Noting
that for solids the shear stress <b>&tau;</b> is
proportional to strain <b>&Delta;&alpha;</b> while
for fluids it is proportional to rate of strain, ${d&gamma;}/{dt}$,
which in turn is defined as 
</P>
<p>
$${d&gamma;}/{dt}=lim_{&Delta;t&rarr;0}({&Delta;&alpha;}/{&Delta;t})$$
</p>
<P>
Substituting for <b>&Delta;&alpha;</b> we
have </P>
<p>
$$ {d&gamma;}/{dt}=U/h={du}/{dy}$$
</p>
<P>
Since <b>&tau;</b> is
proportional to ${d&gamma;}/{dt}$, we have $&tau;&prop;{d&gamma;}/{dt}$ or </P>
<p>
$$&tau;&prop;{du}/{dy}$$
</p>
<P >
It is found that for common fluids such as air, water and oil the relationship between
shear stress and velocity gradient can be expressed as, 
</P>
<p>
$$&tau;=&mu;{du}/{dy}$$</p>
<P >
The constant of proportionality <b>&mu;</b> is
an important property of fluids in determining the flow behaviour and
is called <B>dynamic viscosity</B> or <B>absolute viscosity</B>.
It is usual to refer to it as just <B>viscosity</B>.</p>
<p>
<b>Viscosity</b> has the dimensions <B>FLT</B><SUP><B>-2</B></SUP>
and units of <B>Ns/m</B><SUP><B>2</B></SUP>
in the SI system. 
</P>
<P >
Fluids for which the shear stress varies linearly as rate of strain are
called <b>Newtonian Fluids</b>.
Many of the common fluids belong to this category; eg. air, water, alcohol, etc. When
the relationship between shear stress and rate of strain is not
linear, the fluid is designated <b>Non-Newtonian</b>.
Examples of this category are industrial fluids such as
plastic paint, sludge and biological fluids such as blood. Typical plots
of shear stress versus rate of strain are shown in <i>Fig 5</i>. <b>Rheology</b> is the
branch of fluid mechanics which specialises in these fluids. In this chapter,
primarily common fluids such as water and air or similar Newtonian fluids will be covered.

<br /><U>Figure
5 : Different Fluid Responses</U></center>
<p>
Viscosity
of a fluid is strongly dependent on temperature and is a weak
function of pressure. For example, when the pressure of air is
increased from 1 atm to 50 atm, its viscosity increases only by about
10 percent allowing one to ignore its dependence on pressure. <i>Fig 6</i>
shows the manner of dependence of viscosity on temperature for some
of the common fluids. It is seen that the viscosity of liquids
deceases with temperature while that for the gases increases with
temperature. This difference in behaviour is explained by the cohesive and 
intermolecular forces within the fluid. Liquids are characterized by strong cohesive forces
and close packing of molecules. When temperature increases cohesive
forces are weakened and there is less resistance to motion. Hence
viscosity decreases.</p>
<p>With gases, the cohesive forces are very weak
and the molecules are spaced apart.
Viscosity is due to the exchange of momentum between molecules as a
result of random motion. As the temperature increases the molecular
activity increases giving rise to an increased resistance to motion
or in other words viscosity increases.</P>

<u>Figure 6 : Viscosity Variation with Temperature</u>
</center>
<h3>Formulas for Variation of Viscosity </h3>
</P>
<P>
A widely used formula for the calculation of the variation of viscosity with temperature for gases is the Sutherland
Law given by</P>
<p>
$$&mu;=&mu;_{ref}(T/T_{ref})^{3\/2} {T_{ref}+S}/{T+S}$$
</p>
<P>
where 
$T_{ref}$ is a reference temperature<br />
$&mu;_{ref}$ is the viscosity at the reference temperature<br />
S is the Sutherland temperature
</p>
<p>
This can be written as </p>
<p>
$$&mu;= {C_1 T^{1.5}}/{T+S}$$
</p>
For air $C_1=1.458&times;10^{-6}$ ${kg}/{ms &Sqrt;{K}}$
and S = 110.4 K.</P>
<P>
The Power Law is another approximation to calculate viscosity and is given by 
</P>
<p>
$$&mu;/&mu;_0=(T/T_0)^{0.7}$$
</p>
<P>
where $&mu;_0$ is the value of viscosity at a reference
temperature $T_0$, which
is typically <B>273K</B>.
</P>
<P>
An empirical approximation for the viscosity of liquids is 
</P>
<p>
$$ln(&mu;/&mu;_0)=a+b(T_0/T)+c(T_0/T)^2$$
</p>
<P>
For water, 
$T_0=273.16K$ $&mu;_0=0.001792 {kg}/{ms}$, a=-1.94, b=-4.80 and c=6.74. 
</P>
<P>
Another empirical formula for liquids is the <b>Andrade equation</b> namely, 
</P>
<p>
$$&mu;=De^{B\/T}$$
</p>
<P>
where
<B>B</B>
and <B>D</B>
are constants and <B>T</B>
is the temperature in <B>K </B>
</P>
<h3>
Kinematic
Viscosity, &nu;</h3>
</P>
<P>
In fluid flow problems viscosity often appear in combination with density in the
form 
</P>
<p>
$$&nu;=&mu;/&rho;$$
</p>
<P>
One of the common examples is <b>Reynolds number</b>, defined as <b>VL/&nu;</b>, this is one
 of the very important parameters in fluid dynamics. The term <b>&nu;</b> is
referred to as <b>Kinematic Viscosity</b>
and has the dimensions of <B>L</B><SUP><B>2</B></SUP><B>/T</B>.
<i>Fig. 7</i> shows a plot of <b>&nu;</b> for
air and water against temperature.</P>

<IMG SRC="kinematic_v_v_temp.png" NAME="Picture 56" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=402 HEIGHT=381 BORDER=0><br>
<br><U>Figure 7 : Kinematic Viscosity variation with temperature </U>
</center>
<h3>Density, &rho;</h3>
<P>
Density is defined as mass per unit volume of the substance. However, as
discussed before, in the case of a Continuum Hypothesis, it is
defined as a limit. If  <b>&Delta;M</b> is
the mass of a small volume <b>&Delta;V</b> then
</P>
<p>
$$&rho;=lim_{&Delta;V&rarr;0}({&Delta;m}/{&Delta;V})$$
</p>
<P>
The unit of density in the SI system is <b>kg/m<SUP>3</b>
</SUP>. Under ordinary conditions the density of water is <b>993
Kg/m<SUP>3</SUP></b> while that for air at <b>15<SUP>o</SUP>C</b>
and atmospheric pressure is <b>1.225</b>.
Kg/m<SUP>3</SUP>
</P>
<P>
Density of liquids
is somewhat insensitive to the changes in pressure and temperature.
For gases there is a strong dependence of density on these quantities
and is given by the equation of state of the particular gas. 
</P>
<h3>
Specific Volume, v 
</h3>
<P>
The specific volume, <B>v</B>
of a fluid is defined as the volume per unit mass and its numerical
value is given by the reciprocal of density. 
</P>
<p>
$$v=1/&rho;$$
</p>
<h3>
Specific Weight, &gamma;</h3>
<P>
The specific
weight, <b>&gamma;</b>, of
a fluid is defined as the weight per unit volume and is related to
density. 
</P>
<p>
$$&gamma;=&rho;g$$
</p>
<P>
where <B>g</B> is
acceleration due to gravity. Its units (in SI) are <b>N/m<SUP>3</SUP></b>
. Note that the value of <B>g</B>
is <b>9.807m/s<SUP>2</SUP></b> so that the
 specific weight of water at <b>60<SUP>o</SUP>C</b> is <b>9.8
KN/m<SUP>3</SUP></b>.
For air at <b>15<SUP>o</SUP>C</b>
and atmospheric pressure specific weight is <b>12 N/m<SUP>3</SUP></b>.</P>
<h3>
Specific Gravity, SG </h3>
<P>
The specific gravity, <B>SG</B>
of a fluid is the ratio of its density to that of water under
reference conditions, usually at <b>4<SUP>o</SUP>C</b>
(i.e., <b>1000 Kg/m<SUP>3</SUP></b>.)
</P>
<p>
$$S.G.=&rho;/{&rho;_{water\ at\ 4^oC}}$$
</p>
<P>
Specific gravity being a ratio of densities is independent of units. Its value
for mercury at <b>20<SUP>o</SUP>C </b>
is <B>13.55</B>.
There is not a single set standard for reference density. Sometimes
for gases, density of air under standard conditions <b>1.225
Kg/m<SUP>3</SUP></b> is used as the reference.</P>
<h3>
Pressure, P </h3>
<P>
Pressure along with velocity is one of the main parameters in fluid dynamics. It is
defined as the compressive stress at any point in a fluid at rest.
For a thin plate immersed in a fluid at rest, pressure is the
normal force per unit area exerted on the plate. It is brought about
by the bombardment of fluid molecules upon the solid surface. 
</P>
<P>
Dimensions of pressure are <B>F/L</B><SUP><B>2</B></SUP>
which is also called a <b>Pascal</b>.
</P>
<P>
At low speeds fluid flow is caused by pressure differences and gradients than due to
pressure itself; the actual pressure level within a fluid becomes
less important. But for high speed flows the magnitude of pressure
may become important. At the very low pressure extreme for liquids,
vaporisation may occur.

<P>
Pressure values read by measuring devices such as a manometer are the pressure
levels above the surrounding atmospheric pressure and are called <b>gauge
pressure</b>. When pressure is referred to a vacuum it becomes an <b>absolute
Pressure</b> being the sum of the <b>gauge pressure</b> and <b>atmospheric
pressure.</b>
</P>
<h3>Temperature, T </h3>
<P>
Temperature is a measure of the random molecular motion of the fluid at a point. The
hotter the fluid the more energy is stored in random motion of
molecules.</P>
<P>
The
unit of temperature is <b>Kelvin (K)</b>,
and is an absolute measure of thermal energy. <b>Centigrade
(<SUP>o</SUP>C)</b>, is a relative measure with <b>0 degrees</b> at the freezing point of water.</P>
<h3>Velocity,
U </h3>
<P>
Velocity of the flow is the average speed of all molecules at a point in the
flow at a given time. Velocity is a vector quantity and can be
constructed from three scalar components (<B>u,v,w</B>)
(horizontal, vertical, forward)</P>

<h3>Ideal Gas Law </h3>
<P>
Pressure, density and temperature of a gas are related through an equation of state.
Under ordinary conditions for air, 
</P>
<p>
$$P=&rho;RT$$
</p>
<P>
where
<B>P</B> is
the absolute pressure, &rho; the
density, <B>T</B>
the absolute temperature and <B>R</B>
is a gas constant. The above equation is called the <b>Ideal
Gas Law</b> or the <b>Perfect
Gas Equation</b>. The gases obeying this
equation are called <b>Ideal Gases</b>.
</P>
<P>
The gas constant <B>R</B>
(Ideal Gas Law ) is given by 
</P>
<p>
$$R=&#8477;/M$$
</p>
<P>
where &#8477; is
called the universal gas constant and is equal to <B>8314
J/kg.K</B> and <b>M</b> is the molar mass of the gas. For air the gas constant <B>R
= 286.9 J/kg.K</B> . 
</P>
<h3>
Bulk
Modulus, E<sub>v</sub></h3>
<P>
The bulk modulus determines how compressible a fluid is. In other words, it is a measure 
of how the density of a fluid changes when the fluid is subjected to
pressure. It is defined as 
</P>
<p>
$$E_v=-V_i{dP}/{dV_i}=&rho;{dP}/{d&rho;}$$
</p>
<P>
where <B>dP</B>
is the pressure change that is required in order to change the volume
by $dV_i$, $V_i$ being
the initial volume. The negative sign indicates that an increase in
pressure is accompanied by a decrease in volume. 
</P>
<P>
The dimensions of bulk modulus are <b>FL<SUP>-2</SUP></b>;
the units being <b>N/m<SUP>2</SUP></b>.
Higher values of bulk modulus indicates that it is difficult to
compress the fluid. For example, the bulk modulus of water is <b>2.15
x 10<SUP>9</SUP> N/m<SUP>2</SUP></b>, meaning that it requires an enormous
pressure to change the volume of water by a small amount. For all
practical purposes water (and many other liquids as well) is treated
as being incompressible. 
</P>
<h3>Bulk Modulus for Gases </h3>
<P>
Gases have an equation of state that connects pressure, density and
temperature. This enables us to deduce an
explicit relationship between pressure and density. Such a
relationship depends upon the process being considered - <b>isothermal</b>
(at constant temperature) or <b>isentropic</b>
(at constant entropy). The equations are 
</P>
<p>
$P/&rho;=constant$ For an isothermal process</p>
<P>
and 
</P>
<p>
$P/&rho;^k=constant$ For an isentropic process.</p>
<P>
where <B>k</B> is the ratio of specific heat at
constant pressure, <B>C</B><SUB><B>p</B></SUB>
to the specific heat at constant volume,<B>C</B><SUB><B>v</B></SUB>.</p>
<p>In addition</p><p> 
$$C_P-C_v=R$$
</p>
<p>where <B>R</B> is
the gas constant. Under ordinary conditions <b>k=1.4</b> for air. 
</P>
<P>
By substituting in
the definition for bulk modulus,  
</P>
<p>
$E_v=P$ For an isothermal process<br />
$E_v=kP$ For an isentropic process</p>
<P>
Thus we see that the bulk modulus for a gas depends upon its pressure.
Given that for air the atmospheric pressure at STP conditions is
<b>1.01325 x 10<SUP>5</SUP> N/m<SUP>2</SUP></b>, the bulk modulus is of the 
same order, while that for water it is
<b>2.15 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>
N/m<SUP>2</SUP> </b>
. These figures show that air is about
15,000 times as compressible as water. 
</P>
<h3>Vapour Pressure </h3>
<P>
When a liquid is exposed to atmosphere molecules escape from its surface
in a vapour form. If the liquid is placed in a closed
container, the activity continues so that vapour fills the space in
between the liquid level and the container. A pressure develops and
reaches an equilibrium. The vapour is said to be saturated. The
pressure it exerts upon the liquid surface is the <b>vapour
pressure</b>. 
</P>
<h3>Surface Tension, &sigma;</h3>
<P>
Surface Tension is
acts between two immiscible liquids or between a liquid and
gas, i.e. water and air. The interface between the two fluids is
assumed to act like a stretched membrane under tensile stress. This
stress is required to hold the membrane in position. Many exmaples
can be found in everyday life of the effect of surface tension. A steel
needle will float on water due to the apparent tension developed at
the water surface. Water drops form on smooth surfaces. Tiny spheres
of mercury will form when it is poured on a smooth surface.
Unbalanced cohesive forces acting on liquid molecules at the
interface are balanced by the tensile force due to surface tension. 
</P>
<P>
Surface
tension, <b>&sigma;</b>, is expressed
as force per unit distance <b>(N/m)</b> and has dimensions of <b>FL<SUP>-1</SUP></b>.
Its magnitude depends upon the two fluids in contact and on
temperature. 
</P>
<h3>Pressure inside a Drop of Fluid </h3>
<P>
It is due to surface tension that pressure of a liquid increases within a bubble.
Consider the free-body diagram of a bubble as shown in <i>Fig. 9.</i></P>
<P><br /></p><center>
<IMG SRC="bubble_membrane.png" NAME="Picture 118" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=340 HEIGHT=279 BORDER=0><br><br>
<U>Figure 9 :
Forces acting on a bubble membrane</U></center>
<p>
 If the force due to surface tension at the edge is balanced by the pressure force
inside the bubble, we have 
</P>
<p>
$$2&pi;R&sigma;=P&pi;R^2$$
</p>
<P>
i.e.,</P>
<p>
$$P={2&sigma;}/R$$</p>
<P>
where
<B>P</B> is
the pressure difference between inside the drop and that outside. In
addition the pressure inside the bubble is greater than that outside.
</P>
<h3>
Capillary Tube </h3>
<center>
<IMG SRC="capillary_tube.png" NAME="Picture 122" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=368 HEIGHT=235 BORDER=0><br><br>
<U>Figure 10 :
Capillary Tube</U></center>
<p>
As shown in <i>Fig. 10</i>, if a small open tube is inserted into a container
with water, the water raises into the tube. A
liquid-gas-solid interface is formed. In this case, attraction or adhesion
between solid and water is strong and is able to overcome the mutual
cohesion between liquid molecules. That is why water rises into the
tube. The liquid is said to <b>wet the surface</b>. 
</P>
<P>
The height of the liquid column is related to surface tension, tube
radius, specific weight of the liquid and angle of contact <b>&theta;</b> between
liquid and the tube. The vertical force due to surface tension, <b> 2&pi;R&sigma;cos(&theta;)</b> and
weight of the fluid, <b>&gamma;&pi;R<sup>2</sup>h</b>, will
balance each other.</p> 
<p>
$$&gamma;&pi;R^2h=2&pi;R&sigma;\cos(&theta;)$$
</p>
<P>
or</P>
<p>
$$h={2&sigma;\cos(&theta;)}/{&gamma;R}$$
</p>
<P>
It
is seen that if the tube radius is small the capillary
rise, <B>h</B>,
is pronounced. That is, the narrower the tube more the height to which the
fluid rises in it. Whether the fluid rises in the capillary tube
or not is decided by the <b>contact angle (&theta;)</b> 
shown in <i>Fig. 10</i>. This is the angle between the solid and the liquid
surfaces. When this angle is less than 90<SUP>o</SUP>
the surface tension is such as to pull the fluid through the tube.
There is a meniscus (concave upwards). The liquid is said to <b>wet
the surface</b>.</p>
<p>But when the angle is greater than 90<SUP>o</SUP>,
as happens with mercury, the liquid level is actually depressed and the liquid does <b>not wet
the surface</b>.
